# Autoscale instances

In Azure, it's easier to grow a service with little to no downtime compared to downscaling a service, which usually requires deprovisioning or downtime. In general, opt for scale-out instead of scale up.

For certain applications, capacity requirements might change over time. Autoscaling policies allow for less error-prone operations and cost savings through robust automation.

## Virtual machine instances

For autoscaling, consider the choice of instance size. The size can significantly change the cost of your workload.

## Stateless applications

You can use many Azure services to improve the application's ability to scale dynamically, even if the application isn't originally designed to scale dynamically.

For example, many ASP.NET stateful web applications can be made stateless. Then you can autoscale them, which results in a cost benefit. You store state using [Azure Redis Cache](/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-aspnet-session-state-provider), or Azure Cosmos DB as a back-end session state store through a [session state provider](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetSessionState).
