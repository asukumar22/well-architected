# Networking cost estimates

## Traffic routing and load balancing

Most workloads have a load balancing service to route and distribute traffic. It's done in such a way that a single resource isn't overloaded and the response time is minimum with maximum throughput.

**Do you need to distribute traffic within a region or across regions?**
***

Azure Front Door and Azure Traffic Manager can distribute traffic to backends, clouds, or hybrid on-premises services that reside in multiple regions. Otherwise, for regional traffic that moves within virtual networks or zonal and zone-redundant service endpoints within a region, choose Azure Application Gateway or Azure Load Balancer.

**What is the type of traffic?** 
***

Load balancers such as Azure Application Gateway and Azure Front Door, route and distribute traffic to web applications or HTTP/HTTPS endpoints. Those services support Layer 7 features such as TLS/SSL offload, web application firewall, path-based load balancing, and session affinity. For nonweb traffic, choose Azure Traffic Manager or Azure Load Balancer. Azure Traffic Manager uses DNS to route traffic. Load Balancer supports Layer 4 features for all UDP and TCP protocols.

Here's the matrix for choosing load balancers by considering both dimensions.

|Service| Global/regional|Recommended traffic|
|---|---|---|
|[Azure Front Door](/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview)|Global| HTTP/HTTPS|
|[Azure Traffic Manager](/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview) |Global    |non-HTTP/HTTPS|
|[Azure Application Gateway](/azure/application-gateway/overview)|Regional| HTTP/HTTPS|
|[Azure Load Balancer](/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview)|Regional| non-HTTP/HTTPS|

For more information, see [Choose a load balancing service](/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/load-balancing-overview).

### Example cost analysis

Consider a web application that receives traffic from users across regions over the internet. To minimize the request response time, the load balancer can delegate the responsibility from the web server to a different computer. The application is expected to consume 10 TB of data. Routing rules direct incoming requests to various paths. Also, use Web Application Firewall (WAF) to secure the application through policies.

By using the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/), you can estimate the cost for these two services.

#### Azure Front Door (West US), Zone 1

#### Azure Application Gateway (West US)

Consider a similar example where the type of traffic changes. The application is a UDP streaming service that deploys across regions and the traffic goes over the internet. Use a combination of Azure Traffic Manager and Azure Load Balancer. Azure Traffic Manager is a simple routing service that uses DNS to direct clients to a specific service. Here are the cost estimates:

#### Azure Traffic Manager

|Item|Example estimate|
|---|---|
|DNS queries|100 million x $0.54/per million = $54.00|
|Basic health checks|20 endpoints x $0.36/month = $7.20|
|Fast interval health checks|10 endpoints x $1.00/month = $10.00|
|External endpoints hosted outside Azure|10 endpoints x $0.54/month = $5.40|
|Real user measurements|100 million user measurements x $2.00/month = $200.00|
|Traffic view |100 million data points processed x $2.00/month = $200.00|
|**Total**|$486.60|

#### Azure Load Balancer

|Item|Example estimate|
|---|---|
|Rules|First five rules: $0.032/rule/hour x 730 = $18.25|
||Extra five rules: $0.013/rule/hour x 730 = $36.50|
|Data processed|10 TB x $0.005/GB = 51.20|
|**Total**|$105.95|

## Peering

**Do you need to connect virtual networks?**
***

[Peering technology](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview) is a service that you use for Azure virtual networks to connect with other virtual networks in the same or different Azure region. Hub and spoke architectures often use peering technology.

There are extra costs incurred by peering connections on both egress and ingress traffic traversing the peering connections.
> ![Task](./images/i-best-practices.png) If possible, keep the top talking services of a workload within the same virtual network, zone, and region. Use virtual networks as shared resources for multiple workloads against a single virtual network per workload approach. This approach localizes traffic to a single virtual network and avoids the additional costs on peering charges.

### Example cost analysis

> This example uses current prices and is subject to change. The example shows prices and calculations for illustrative purposes only.

Peering within the same region is cheaper than peering between regions or Global regions. For instance, you consume 50 TB per month by connecting two VNETs in Central US. Using the current price here's the incurred cost.

|Item|Example estimate|
|---|---|
|Ingress traffic|50 TB x $0.0100/GB = $512.50|
|Egress traffic|50 TB x $0.0100/GB = $512.50|
|**Total**|$1,025.00|

Compare that cost for cross-region peering between Central US and East US.

|Item|Example estimate|
|---|---|
|Ingress traffic|50 TB x $0.0350/GB   = $1,792.00|
|Egress traffic|50 TB x $0.0350/GB =   $1,792.00|
|**Total** |$3,584.00|

## Hybrid connectivity

There are two main options for connecting an on-premises datacenter to Azure datacenters:

- [Azure VPN gateway](/azure/vpn-gateway/). Use Azure VPN gateway to connect a virtual network to an on-premises network through a VPN appliance or to Azure Stack through a site-to-site VPN tunnel.
- [Azure ExpressRoute](/azure/expressroute/). Create private connections between Azure datacenters and infrastructure that's on premise or in a colocation environment.

**What is the required throughput for cross-premises connectivity?**
***

We recommend VPN gateway for development and test cases or small-scale production workloads where throughput is less than 100 Mbps. Use Azure ExpressRoute for enterprise and mission-critical workloads that access most Azure services. You can choose bandwidth from 50 Mbps to 10 Gbps.

Another consideration is security. Unlike VPN gateway traffic, Azure ExpressRoute connections don't go over the public internet. Industry-standard IPsec secures the VPN gateway traffic.

For both services, inbound transfers are free and outbound transfers are billed per the billing zone.

For more information, see [Choose a solution for connecting an on-premises network to Azure](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/index).

This [article](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/expressroute-or-virtual-network-vpn-whats-right-for-me/) provides a comparison of the two services.

### Example cost analysis

This example compares the pricing details for VPN gateway and Azure ExpressRoute.
> The example uses current prices and is subject to change. The example shows prices and calculations for illustrative purposes only.

#### Azure VPN Gateway

Suppose you choose the **VpnGw2AZ** tier, which supports availability zones, 1 GB/s bandwidth. The workload needs 15 site-to-site tunnels and 1 TB of outbound transfer. The gateway is provisioned and available for 720 hours.

|Item|Example estimate|
|---|---|
|VPN Hours|720 x $0.564 = $406.08
Site to Site (S2S) Tunnels| The first 10 tunnels are free. For more tunnels, the cost is five tunnels x 720 hours x $0.015 per hour per tunnel = $54.00|
|Outbound transfer| 1024 GB x 0.086 = $88.65|
|Total cost per month| $548.73|

#### Azure ExpressRoute

Choose the **Metered Data** plan in billing zone of **Zone 1**.

|Item|Example estimate|
|---|---|
|Circuit bandwidth|1 GB/s speed has a fixed rate of $436.00 for the standard price.|
|Outbound transfer|1 TB x $0.0025 = $25.60|
|Total cost per month|$461.00|

The main cost driver is outbound data transfer. Azure ExpressRoute is more cost-effective than Azure VPN Gateway when consuming large amounts of outbound data. If you consume more than 200 TB per month, consider Azure ExpressRoute with the **Unlimited Data** plan where you're charged a flat rate.
