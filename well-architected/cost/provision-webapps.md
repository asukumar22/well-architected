# Web application cost estimates

All web applications (apps) have no up-front cost or termination fees. Some charge only for what you use and others charge per-second or per-hour. In addition, all web apps run in Azure App Service plans. Together these costs can help determine the total cost of a web app.

Use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) to help create various cost scenarios.

## App Service plans

App Service plans include the set of compute resources needed for the web app to run. Except for with the Free tier, an App Service plan carries a charge on the compute resources it uses. For a description of App Service plans, see [Azure App Service plan overview](/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans).

You can potentially save money by choosing one or more App Service plans. To help find the solution that meets your business requirements, see [Should I put an app in a new plan or an existing plan?](/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans#should-i-put-an-app-in-a-new-plan-or-an-existing-plan)

The *pricing tier* of an App Service plan determines what App Service features you get and how much you pay for the plan. The higher the tier, the higher the cost. For details on the pricing tiers, see [App Service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/windows/).

You don't get charged for using the App Service features that are available to you, such as configuring custom domains, TLS/SSL certificates, deployment slots, and backups. For a list of exceptions, see [How much does my App Service plan cost?](/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans#how-much-does-my-app-service-plan-cost)

## App Service cost

App Service plans are billed on a per second basis. If your solution includes several App Service apps, consider deploying them to separate App Service plans. This approach enables you to scale apps independently because they run on separate instances. This approach saves unnecessary cost.

Azure App Service supports two types of TLS/SSL connections: Server Name Indication (SNI) TLS/SSL Connections and IP Address TLS/SSL Connections. SNI-based TLS/SSL works on modern browsers while IP-based TLS/SSL works on all browsers. If your business requirements allow, use SNI-based TLS/SSL instead of IP-based TLS/SSL. There's no charge for SNI-based TLS/SSL. IP-based TLS/SSL incurs a cost per connection.

For more information, see SSL Connections in [App Service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/windows/).

## API Management cost

If you want to publish APIs hosted on Azure, on-premises, and in other clouds more securely, reliably, and at scale, use Azure API Management. The pricing tier you choose depends on the features needed based on your business requirements. For example, depending on your requirements for scalability, the number of units required to scale out range from 1 to 10. As the number of units increases, the cost of the pricing tier increases.

Self-hosted gateways are available in the Developer and Premium pricing tiers. There's an extra cost for this service if you use the Premium tier. There's no cost for self-hosted gateways if you use the Developer tier.

For pricing details, see [API Management pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/api-management/).

## Content Delivery Network cost

If you want to offer users optimal online content delivery, use Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) in your workload. The data size that you use has the most significant effect on cost. Choose based on your business requirements. Purchasing data in increments of TB is significantly higher than purchasing data in increments of GB.

The provider you choose also can affect cost. Choose Microsoft as the provider to get the lowest cost.

Some data, such as shopping carts, search results, and other dynamic content, isn't cacheable. CDN offers Acceleration Data Transfers, also called Dynamic Site Acceleration (DSA), to accelerate this type of web content. The price for DSA is the same across Standard and Premium profiles.

For pricing details, see [Content Delivery Network pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cdn/).

## Azure Cognitive Search cost

To set up and scale a search experience quickly and cost-effectively, use Azure Cognitive Search. When you create an Azure Cognitive Search service, a resource is created at a pricing tier or SKU that's fixed for the lifetime of the service. Billing depends on the type of service. For a list of services, see [What are Azure Cognitive Services](/azure/cognitive-services/welcome#search-apis).

The charges are based on the number of transactions for each type of operation specific to a service. Some transactions are free. If you need more transactions, choose from the Standard instances.

For pricing details, see [Azure Cognitive Search pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search).

## Azure SignalR Service cost

Use SignalR for any scenario that requires pushing data from server to client in real time. For example, Azure SignalR Service provides secure and simplified communication between client and app one-to-one, such as a chat window. It also provides communication for one-to-many, such as instant broadcasting, IoT dashboards, or notification to social network. To learn more about Azure SignalR Service, see [What is Azure SignalR Service?](/azure/azure-signalr/signalr-overview#what-is-azure-signalr-service-used-for)

We don't recommend the Free tier for a production environment. With the Standard tier, you pay only for what you use. We recommend the Standard tier as an enterprise solution because it offers a large number of concurrent connections and messages.

For pricing details, see [Azure SignalR Service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/signalr-service).

## Notification Hubs cost

To broadcast push notifications to millions of users at once or tailor notifications to individual users, use Azure Notification Hubs. Pricing is based on number of pushes. The Free tier is a good starting point for exploring push capabilities but we don't recommend it for production apps. If you require more pushes and features such as scheduled pushes or multi-tenancy, you can buy more pushes per million.

For more information, see [Push notifications with Azure Notification Hubs](/azure/notification-hubs/notification-hubs-push-notification-faq). For pricing details, see [Notification Hubs pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/notification-hubs/).
