# Monitoring for reliability

Monitoring and diagnostics are crucial for reliability. If something fails, you need to know *that* it failed, *when* it failed, and *why*.

## Checklist

How do you monitor and measure application health?

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - The application is instrumented with semantic logs and metrics.
> - Application logs are correlated across components.
> - All components are monitored and correlated with application telemetry.
> - Key metrics, thresholds, and indicators are defined and captured.
> - A health model has been defined based on performance, availability, and recovery targets.
> - Azure Service Health events are used to alert on applicable service level events.
> - Azure Resource Health events are used to alert on resource health events.
> - Monitor long-running workflows for failures.
