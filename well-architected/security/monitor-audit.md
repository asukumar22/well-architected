# Security audits

To make sure that the security posture doesn't degrade over time, have regular auditing that checks compliance with organizational standards. Enable, acquire, and store audit logs for Azure services.

## Key points

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Improve secure score in Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
> - Use an industry standard benchmark to evaluate your organizations current security posture.
> - Perform regular internal and external compliance audits, including regulatory compliance attestations.
> - Review the policy requirements.
> - Use [Azure Governance Visualizer](https://aka.ms/alz/azgovviz) for a holistic overview of your technical Azure Governance implementation.

## Evaluate using standard benchmarks

**Do you evaluate the security posture of this workload using standard benchmarks?**
***

Use an industry standard benchmark to evaluate your organizations current security posture.

Benchmarking allows you to improve your security program by learning from external organizations. It lets you know how your current security state compares to that of other organizations, providing both external validation for successful elements of your current system and identifying gaps that serve as opportunities to enrich your team's overall security strategy. Even if your security program isn't tied to a specific benchmark or regulatory standard, you will benefit from understanding the documented ideal states by those outside and inside of your industry.

As an example, the Center for Internet Security (CIS) has created security benchmarks for Azure that map to the CIS Control Framework. Another reference example is the MITRE ATT&CK&trade; framework that defines the various adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. These external references control mappings and help you to understand any gaps between your current strategy, what you have, and what other experts have in the industry.

### Suggested action

Develop an Azure security benchmarking strategy aligned to industry standards.

As people in the organization and on the project change, it is crucial to make sure that only the right people have access to the application infrastructure. Auditing and reviewing access control reduces the attack vector to the application. Azure control plane depends on Azure AD and access reviews are often centrally performed as part of internal, or external audit activities.

Make sure that the security team is auditing the environment to report on compliance with the security policy of the organization. Security teams may also enforce compliance with these policies.

## Audit regulatory compliance

Compliance is important for several reasons. Aside from signifying levels of standards, like `ISO 27001` and others, noncompliance with regulatory guidelines may bring sanctions and penalties. Regularly review roles that have high privileges. Set up a recurring review pattern to ensure that accounts are removed from permissions as roles change. Consider auditing at least twice a year.

### Suggested action

Use Microsoft Defender for Cloud to continuously assess and monitor your compliance score.

**Have you established a monitoring and assessment solution for compliance?**
***
Continuously assess and monitor the compliance status of your workload. Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides a regulatory compliance dashboard that shows the current security state of workload against controls mandated by the standard governments or industry organizations and Azure Security Benchmark. Keep your resources in compliance with those standards. Defender for Cloud tracks many standards. You can set the standards by management groups in a subscription.

Consider using [Azure Access Reviews](/azure/active-directory/governance/access-reviews-overview) or [Entitlement Management](/azure/active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-overview) to periodically review access to the workload.

Consider using [Azure Access Reviews](/azure/active-directory/governance/access-reviews-overview) or [Entitlement Management](/azure/active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-overview) to periodically review access to the workload.

For Azure, use Azure Policy to create and manage policies that enforce compliance.  Azure Policies are built on the Azure Resource Manager capabilities.  Azure Policy can also be assigned through Azure Blueprints.

For more information, see [Tutorial: Create and manage policies to enforce compliance](/azure/governance/policy/tutorials/create-and-manage).

Here's an example management group that is tracking compliance to the Payment Card Industry (PCI) standard.

**Do you have internal and external audits for this workload?**
***

A workload should be audited internally, external, or both with the goal of discovering security gaps. Make sure that the gaps are addressed through updates.

Auditing is important for workloads that follow a standard. Aside from signifying levels of standards, noncompliance with regulatory guidelines may bring sanctions and penalties.

Perform regulatory compliance attestation. Attestations are done by an independent party that examines if the workload is in compliance with a standard.

## Review critical access

**Is access to the control plane and data plane of the application periodically reviewed?**
***

Regularly review roles that have high privileges. Set up a recurring review pattern to ensure that accounts are removed from permissions as roles change. Consider auditing at least twice a year.

As people in the organization and on the project change, make sure that only the right people, have access to the application infrastructure and just enough privileges to complete the task. Auditing and reviewing the access control reduces the attack vector to the application.

Azure control plane depends on Azure AD. You can conduct the review manually or through an automated process by using tools such as [Azure AD access reviews](/azure/active-directory/governance/create-access-review). These reviews are often centrally performed often as part of internal or external audit activities.

## Check policy compliance

Make sure that the security team is auditing the environment to report on compliance with the security policy of the organization. Security teams may also enforce compliance with these policies.

Enforce and audit industry, government, and internal corporate security policies. Policy monitoring checks that initial configurations are correct and that it continues to be compliant over time.

For Azure, use Azure Policy to create and manage policies that enforce compliance. Azure Policies are built on the Azure Resource Manager capabilities. Azure Policy can also be assigned through Azure Blueprints.  For more information, see [Tutorial: Create and manage policies to enforce compliance](/azure/governance/policy/tutorials/create-and-manage).

## Capture critical data

[Azure Governance Visualizer](https://aka.ms/alz/azgovviz) captures data from the most relevant Azure governance capabilities such as Azure Policy, Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC), and Azure Blueprints. The visualizer PowerShell script iterates through an Azure tenant's management group hierarchy down to the subscription level. From the collected data, the visualizer shows your hierarchy map, creates a tenant summary, and builds granular scope insights about your management groups and subscriptions.
